# Weather Information Service

## Overview
The Weather Information Service is a Spring Boot application that fetches and displays weather information based on user input (city or location). The application interacts with an external weather API (e.g., Weatherstack) to retrieve real-time weather data and displays it on a simple web interface.

## Features
- Fetch weather data for any city or location using the Weatherstack API.
- Display weather information such as temperature and weather descriptions.
- Store fetched weather data in a database using JPA and Hibernate.
- Simple and responsive web interface powered by Thymeleaf.
